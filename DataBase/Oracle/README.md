# Oracle/PLSQL

Oracle is a relational database technology developed by Oracle.

PLSQL stands for "Procedural Language extensions to SQL", and is an extension of SQL that is used in Oracle. PLSQL is closely integrated into the SQL language, yet it adds programming constructs that are not native to SQL.

This note is based on Oracle Database 11g. My Oracle Assignment and lib is [here](Oracle_Lib).
